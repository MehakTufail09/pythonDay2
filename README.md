Refactoring:
Develop a Python program to determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers provided by the user. The refactored code prioritizes modularity and readability by segregating the logic into distinct functions. The `calculate_gcd` function focuses on GCD computation, `get_user_input` manages user input, and `display_result` handles the presentation of the final result. This approach enhances code organization, promoting maintainability and improving overall program readability.
